# Future Considerations

This document tracks deferred work, follow-up decisions, and speculative ideas that extend beyond the current implementation milestone. Keep entries short and actionable so we can revisit them after the core block model is stabilized.

## Backlog

- **Typed content validators:** Revisit a `TypedContent` helper to enforce which content keys (`plain_text`, `object`, `data`) are legal/required per block type once the new schema settles.
